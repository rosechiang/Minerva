Highly multiplexed imaging of protein biomarkers at single-cell resolution holds significant promise in understanding the cellular heterogeneity and intricate topography of breast tissues. Through this approach, researchers can examine numerous biomarkers simultaneously, providing detailed insights into cell lineage, activation states, immune checkpoints, tissue structure, apoptosis, DNA damage, and metabolism. Multiplexed imaging, such as that achieved with the PhenoCycler\u2122-Fusion, has the potential to revolutionize breast cancer research by enabling comprehensive spatial phenotyping of cancerous tissues. This enhanced understanding can lead to more accurate diagnoses, personalized treatment plans, and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Furthermore, by mapping the interactions between cancerous and non-cancerous cells within the tissue, multiplexed imaging may unveil previously unknown mechanisms driving breast cancer progression or resistance to treatment, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.", "Arrows": [], "Overlays": [], "Group": "Overview", "Masks": [], "ActiveMasks": [], "Zoom": 0.46513607872275625, "Pan": [0.3282051282051196, 0.46909751227102015]}, {"Name": "Tumor marker group1", "Description": "E-cadherin (E-cad) is a cell adhesion molecule that plays a critical role in maintaining the structure and integrity of epithelial tissues. In cancer, the loss or downregulation of E-cadherin is often associated with increased invasiveness and metastasis, particularly in epithelial-derived cancers, such as breast cancer. As a result, E-cadherin is often used as a marker to assess the aggressiveness of a tumor and its potential for metastasis.\n\nKi67 is a protein expressed in the nucleus of cells during the active phases of the cell cycle (G1, S, G2, and M phases). Ki67 is not present in resting cells (G0 phase). Consequently, Ki67 serves as a marker for cellular proliferation and is used to evaluate the growth rate of tumors. In breast cancer, a high Ki67 expression often indicates a more aggressive tumor with a poorer prognosis.\n\nPan-cytokeratin (panCK) is a broad-spectrum antibody that detects multiple types of cytokeratins, which are intermediate filament proteins found in epithelial cells. PanCK is used to identify epithelial-derived tumors or to confirm the epithelial origin of metastatic cancer cells. In the context of breast cancer, panCK staining can help differentiate breast carcinoma cells from other cell types within the tumor microenvironment.", "Arrows": [], "Overlays": [], "Group": "Tumor marker1", "Masks": [], "ActiveMasks": [], "Zoom": 10.205346816000011, "Pan": [0.19078575968189318, 0.5600142879579099]}, {"Name": "Tumor marker group2", "Description": "Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) is a protein involved in DNA replication and repair processes, playing a vital role in cell cycle progression.

In cancer research, including breast cancer, PCNA is used to assess tumor cell proliferation, which may have prognostic implications, as high PCNA expression often correlates with more aggressive tumors and poorer outcomes.\n\nKeratin 14 (K14) is an intermediate filament protein specifically expressed in basal epithelial cells. It helps maintain the structural integrity of these cells and contributes to their mechanical resilience. In breast cancer, K14 is often used as a biomarker to identify basal-like breast carcinomas, a subtype associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poorer prognosis. K14 expression can help differentiate basal-like tumors from other breast cancer subtypes and guide treatment decisions.\n\nKeratin 8 (K8) is another intermediate filament protein expressed predominantly in simple epithelial cells, providing mechanical stability and playing a role in cell signaling. In the context of breast cancer, K8 serves as a marker for luminal epithelial cells and is often used alongside other keratins (e.g., K18) to identify luminal-type breast carcinomas.

Blood vessels supply nutrients and oxygen to both healthy and cancerous cells, and in the context of breast cancer, they enable tumor growth and survival. Tumors can stimulate the growth of new blood vessels through a process called angiogenesis, which allows them to secure a steady supply of resources and expand further.\n\nThe vasculature also serves as a conduit for breast cancer cells to enter the circulatory system and metastasize to distant sites, forming secondary tumors. This metastatic process is responsible for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths.

As part of the tumor microenvironment, they can exhibit both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic properties depending on various factors. In their anti-tumorigenic state, M1 macrophages actively work to eliminate cancer cells by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines and promoting cytotoxic T cell responses. However, the tumor microenvironment can also convert macrophages into a pro-tumorigenic state, known as M2 macrophages, which can promote cancer growth, invasion, and metastasis by secreting growth factors and immunosuppressive cytokines.\nSome experimental treatments aim to repolarize M2 macrophages to the M1 phenotype, harnessing their anti-tumorigenic properties to fight cancer. In addition, advanced imaging techniques, such as multiplexed imaging, can help visualize and identify macrophages within breast cancer tissues, providing valuable insights into their function and interaction with cancer cells.\n\nIn summary, macrophages represent an important target for breast cancer research and treatment development.
